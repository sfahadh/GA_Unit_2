## Getting started:
- You will be working in pairs for this morning exercise.  Use the driver/navigator paradigm between you and your partner.
- Fork and clone this repo, then `cd` into the project and run `npm install` followed by `npm start.`  
- We have given you starter code for **Steps 1** and **2**. **Steps 3** and **4** are up to you! Find the Allspark within you!


##
**Step 1.** Inside the `renderNames()` function use `map` to return a new array of transformers' names.   
**Step 2.** Inside the `filterAutobots()` method use `filter` to return a new array of only Autobots.    
**Step 3.** Use `filter` to return a new array of transformers with only vehicle forms.  
**Step 4** Use `map` to return a new array of transformers forms and then `filter` that array and return the transformer with the name that **includes** the word 'Beetle'.
**Step 5.** Use `map` to return an array of objects that have a `name` and a `photo` property. Then, loop through the new array and render an `h1` with the name and an `img` element with the photo in `App.js`.   

*After you complete the above, create components and pass the methods in as props.
